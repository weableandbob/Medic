Have you ever been doing Baneclaw and been unable to find a downed player in the sea of Mammoths? Have you ever been doing a crowded ARES mission and been unable to find an injured player? Well, this addon should help alleviate situations like those.

Medic! is an addon that places a noticeable marker above a player who needs a revive or healing, making it easy to find them in a crowded area. It also has the option to display who needs healing/a revive in chat if you so desire. It's fully customizable, allowing you to control when it notifies you based on class and distance from people, and for how long.

Compatable with Melder - if you're pulling this from Github, just zip all the files up and add it to your addons folder.
